# War
Game of war application

## Still like to do

- Finish out all unit tests. 
    - There's quite a few bugs that are pretty deep in the process that would probably be solved by just creating clean and well used unit tests.
    - Fix broken unit tests.
    - Fix bugs including the infinite loop bug when you have higher than 50 players.

- Add styling.
    - Right now all the styling is bare bones in favour of functionality.
    - I would add actual cards and actual deck area.
    - I would add a background and something to just give the game a good feel.

- I would add some recognition of a stalemate in play for the last 2 players.
